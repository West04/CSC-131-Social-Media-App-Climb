# Climb

An app to facilitate communication and discussion between everyone.

## How It Works

The user will find a "forest" of ideas to explore from.
A "tree" will show them the topic of interest, the "branches" will show thm posts, and "leaves" will show comments that contribute to the idea.

## Using the App

Open in [browser](https://amplify-dev.d3m0u8xtms1lc.amplifyapp.com/).

Once you sign in, you will find tabs for:
- Home Page
- Followed Topics
- For You Page
- User Created Posts

This is a work in progress.
